# PingPong
Simple Ping Pong game.

WHAT I LEARNT:
1. Creating animations using CSS and Javascript
2. Creating a very basic AI system
3. Creating mouse events (moving one of the paddles). 

WHAT I COULD IMPROVE ON:
1. Game is very basic, has no scoring system
2. The ball movement could be more dynamic. 
3. The AI could be better
4. There is 'clipping' where the paddles move beyond the game area.
